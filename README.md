# 🚀 KRRNT – A Modern Microblogging Platform

**KRRNT** is a full-stack Twitter-like clone built to showcase practical skills in modern web development using **Next.js**, with server-side rendering (SSR), integrated authentication, and media handling. This project was created as a personal milestone to test and apply what I’ve learned after diving into the Next.js ecosystem.

---

## ✨ Tech Stack

* **Next.js** – SSR, routing, and frontend framework
* **Supabase** – Authentication, Postgres database, and image storage (buckets)
* **Zod** – Schema validation for client-side auth (login/signup)
* **Zustand** – Lightweight and scalable state management
* **TypeScript** – End-to-end type safety

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

* ✅ Full authentication flow using Supabase Auth
* 📸 Image upload and storage via Supabase Buckets
* 📝 Create, read, and interact with micro-posts
* 📦 Scalable and clean state management with Zustand

## 🚧 Challenges & Lessons Learned

Setting up Supabase for auth, database, and file storage presented real-world complexity. Through Zod, I ensured input validation remained reliable and secure. This project helped sharpen my debugging, architecture planning, and state modeling skills.
